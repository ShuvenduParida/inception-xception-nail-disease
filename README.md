# Nail Disease Diagnosis: Comparative Analysis of InceptionV3 and Xception Models

This project presents a deep learning-based diagnostic system to classify six types of nail diseases using two advanced convolutional neural network architectures — **InceptionV3** and **Xception**. The models are compared for accuracy, robustness, and efficiency using a publicly available medical image dataset.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Nail diseases such as fungal infections, pitting, and melanoma are often early indicators of serious health conditions. Traditional diagnosis relies on expert evaluation and is time-consuming. This study explores how deep learning can enhance speed and accuracy in nail disease detection.

- 📌 **Models Used**: InceptionV3, Xception
- 🎯 **Goal**: Compare performance in classifying 6 nail disease categories
- 🧪 **Accuracy Achieved**:
  - Xception: **97.5%**
  - InceptionV3: **95.12%**
- 📊 Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, AUC-ROC
